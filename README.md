## Description 📝

To build this text editor, i will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. I will use a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by many companies
